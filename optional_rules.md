# Additional Optional Rules #

**Victory at Any Price:** There can be no half-measures in *CQB* battles. No quarter asked or given. To reflect this, if for any reason a mission results in a draw, the force when suffered the fewest destroyed units counts as having won. Note that units not yet deployed count as destroyed for the purposes of this rule.

**Fog of War:** *CQB* battles are chaotic things. Vox relays go down. Couriers and runners get lost, or are ambushed and slain. Rumors and garbled messages from panicked defenders can exaggerate the scope of an enemy attack.

If both players wish to do so, instead of deploying units they may deploy numbered counters representing a unit, with a list of which unit corresponds to which counter written down in advance and hidden from their opponent before the game begins. These counters are moved as appropriate - note that a clever opponent may gauge the identiy of units moving particularly swiftly, or using special rules. Once they enter line of sight of an opposing unit, engage in a shooting attack or charge, they are revealed, and the counter is replaced by the unit's models, placed in coherency around where the counter was.

Should this unit destroy it's enemies and escape from line of sight, at the player's discretion they may once more be replaced with the counter.
