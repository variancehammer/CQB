# Expansions #

Expansions are special rules that pertain to particular *CQB* environments. For example, while those boarding a void-going starship risk dangerous depressurization, those attacking an Adeptus Mechanicus research station may encounter malfunctioning machinery, or defensive systems that no longer distinguish friend from foe.

While some of these are derived from the original Zone Mortalis source material, the majority of them are fan-made, and it must be reiterated that they are *not* intended to be balanced, and should not be used outside narrative play.

## Void War ##

*Void Exposure:* Each time a weapon with Strength 4 or greater makes a wound roll of 6+, that hit is resolved at AP -3, unless its AP value is better. All weapon or attacks which have a similar rule now trigger on a roll of 5+.

*Note:* While this rule is actually marginally *less* effective than the previous 7th Edition incarnation of Rending, the overall lethality increase in 8th Edition means this rule can make things *especially* bloody. I advise only using this rule in *parts* of a CQB battle or special areas - a leaking reactor core, a chamber where a starship's hull has already ruptured, etc.

## Toxic Environments ##

*Poisoned Air:* Each time a weapon with Strength 4 or greater makes a wound roll of 6+, that hit is resolved at AP -3, unless its AP value is better. All weapon or attacks which have a similar rule now trigger on a roll of 5+.

## Mines ##

*Buried Alive*: Mine shafts and other underground environments are highly unstable, especially with the deployment of powerful weapons, seismic breaching charges, etc. If a mission uses this table, on each turn after the first each player should roll a D6 at the beginning of the turn, and add the results of both rolls together. Compare that result to the following chart. If any ranged weapons of Strength 10 or higher has been used in the preceding turn add +1 to the total.

| Roll | Result |
|------|--------|
| 2-5    | *Stable:* No Effect.   | 
| 6-7    | *Stray Shot:* Both players roll off. The winner may choose a single enemy unit. On a 3+, that unit takes D6 hits at Strength 5, AP -2.    |
| 8-9    | *Dust and Debris:* Clouds of dust, debris, and fine particulates fill the air. For this turn only, all models suffer a -1 To Hit penalty for all Shooting attacks.    |
| 10   | *Tremor:* The ground shakes and shifts beneath the clashing armies. All units suffer -2 to their Movement characteristic, to a minimum of 1.    |
| 11    | *Cave-in:* Both players roll off. The winner of that roll may choose D3 enemy units. On a 3+, each unit takes D6 hits at Strength 5, AP -2.    |
| 12+    | *Earthquake!:* Every model on the table must roll a D6. Every model that rolls above their Strength characteristic is removed as a casualty. *Characters* may re-roll this test if tailed. This may only happen once a game - if a 12+ is rolled again, treat this as having no effect.   |
