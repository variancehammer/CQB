# Missions and Stratagems #

Expansions are special rules that pertain to particular *CQB* environments. For example, while those boarding a void-going starship risk dangerous depressurization, those attacking an Adeptus Mechanicus research station may encounter malfunctioning machinery, or defensive systems that no longer distinguish friend from foe.

While some of these are derived from the original Zone Mortalis source material, the majority of them are fan-made, and it must be reiterated that they are *not* intended to be balanced, and should not be used outside narrative play.

## Missions ##

**Assault**

This mission represents a classic *CQB* battle, with an attacker having launched an assault on a vital area. One player takes up the role of the Attacker, and the other the roll of the Defender.

*Table Setup*: A *CQB* environment is a confused tangle of access tunnels, corridors, chambers and rooms, and should be set up appropriate. Terrain should be extremely dense, form natural channels, and have clear and unambiguous doorways. The board should be laid out in a mutually agreeable fashion by both players, or set-up by alternating between placing terrain features. The play area should be set up so that each board edge has at least one clear entry and exit point *per player*.

*Battle-forged Armies*: Any benefit to Battle-forged armies that benefit Troops units (such as the Space Marine's *Defenders of Humanity* rule) also benefit Elite units.

*Deployment*: Before the battle begins, both players should divide their forces into two roughly equal groups (as measured by both number of units and Power Levels). They must decide which of these two forces is their spearhead, and which is their reserve. This division represents an attacking force converging on a critical location, and a defending force rallying to its defense.

The table is then divided into four quarters, and the players roll off to choose a deployment zone. The winner picks which is to be their deployment zone. The opposing player than rolls a D6 - on a 4+ then may choose any of the three remaining zones - otherwise they deploy in the opposite zone to their opponent. Players should alternate placing their models their deployment zone, not within 6" of the center of the table, starting with the player who did not pick the deployment zone.

*First Turn*: “The players roll off, and the player who finished setting up their army first adds 1 to their result. The winner can choose to take the first or second turn. If they choose to take the first turn, their opponent can attempt to seize the initiative by rolling a D6 - on a result of 6, they may take the first turn instead.

*Victory Conditions*: At the end of the game, the player with the most victory points is the winner. If both players have the same, the victor is the player who killed the most enemy units.

Before the start of the game, the players should agree upon - or roll a D6 to decide - the primary objective of the game, consulting the table below:

| Roll | Result |
|------|--------|
| 1-2    | *Search and Destroy*: The objective is to destroy the enemy's force, and win through attrition and slaughter. Each player scores 1 victory point for each enemy unit that is destroyed   | 
| 3-4    | *Force the Breach!*: The Defenders are trying to hold a vital strategic area - environmental controls, the reactor room, or the bridge of a starship, while the attackers are trying to wrest it from them. The Defender places three objectives - one in their deployment zone and one each in the two unused deployment zones. They may not be placed within 6" of the table edge or the 6" zone in the center of the table. These defenses are worth 2 victory points each. |
| 5-6    | *Sabotage*: The Attacker's goal is to destroy a number of vital systems, disrupting the larger scope of the battle. The Defender places D3+2 objective markers on the table. These markers represent control panels, computer console, life support systems, or other critical points. They may be placed anywhere on the table other than within 6" of a table edge or 12" of each other. The attacker must attempt to destroy these objectives. Treat them as having Toughness 4, 2 Wounds and a 2+ armor save. Because the Attackers cannot be assured of their complete destruction from a distance, they also have a 4+ invulnerable save against shooting attacks. These may not be chosen as the targets for any environmental effects such as the *Buried Alive* special rules, etc. At the end of the game, each objective the attackers have destroyed is worth 1 victory point to the attacker, while the defenders gain 1 victory point for each remaining objective. |

In addition to these primary objects, victory points may be earned for the following achievements:

* *Slay the Warlord*: If the enemy Warlord has been slain during the battle, you score 1 victory point.

* *First Blood*: The first unit, of any kind, to be destroyed is worth an additional victory point to the opposing player at the end of the game. If two or more units from opposing forces are destroyed simultaneously, each player gets a victory point.

**Encounter**

This mission represents two hostile forces advancing through unfamiliar and unoccupied territory. Both forces should use the *Combatant* role, and build their forces from one or more Patrol detachments.

*Table Setup*: A *CQB* environment is a confused tangle of access tunnels, corridors, chambers and rooms, and should be set up appropriate. Terrain should be extremely dense, form natural channels, and have clear and unambiguous doorways. The board should be laid out in a mutually agreeable fashion by both players, or set-up by alternating between placing terrain features. The play area should be set up so that each board edge has at least one clear entry and exit point *per player*.

*Battle-forged Armies*: Any benefit to Battle-forged armies that benefit Troops units (such as the Space Marine's *Defenders of Humanity* rule) also benefit Elite units.

*Deployment*: Before the battle begins, both players should divide their forces into two roughly equal groups (as measured by both number of units and Power Levels). They must decide which of these two forces is their spearhead, and which is their reserve. This division represents a smaller force scouting ahead in unfamiliar ground before summoning reinforcements when contact is made with the enemy.

The players should then roll off, with the winner choosing which of the table edges is to be their deployment zone. Their opponent uses the opposite table edge as their deployment zone. Players should alternate placing their models within 6" of their table edge, starting with the player who did not pick the deployment zone.

*First Turn*: “The players roll off, and the player who finished setting up their army first adds 1 to their result. The winner can choose to take the first or second turn. If they choose to take the first turn, their opponent can attempt to seize the initiative by rolling a D6 - on a result of 6, they may take the first turn instead.

*Victory Conditions*: At the end of the game, the player with the most victory points is the winner. If both players have the same, the victor is the player who killed the most enemy units.

Before the start of the game, the players should agree upon - or roll a D6 to decide - the primary objective of the game, consulting the table below:

| Roll | Result |
|------|--------|
| 1-2    | *Search and Destroy*: The objective is to destroy the enemy's force, and win through attrition and slaughter. Each player scores 1 victory point for each enemy unit that is destroyed   | 
| 3-4    | *Capture Ground*: The forces are attempting to control large portions of the battlefield, in order to search them more carefully for intelligence items, secure access points for reinforcements, or other more esoteric objectives. Five objective tokens are placed, with one as close to the center of the board as possible, and the players alternating placement of the other four, beginning with the player who did not determine deployment, such that they are at least 6" away from each other and any table edge. Controlling the center objective is worth 3 victory points, and the control of other objectives are each worth 1. When playing on a larger table, such as a 6' x 4' table, increase the number of objectives to 7. |
| 5-6    | *Overrun*: Having made contact with the enemy, the opposing forces now seek to fight their way into enemy-held territory, seizing on their momentary advantage to make inroads into otherwise heavily defended areas. For each unit within the enemy deployment zone at the end of the game, the owning player gains 3 victory points. For every destroyed enemy unit, the player gains 1 victory point.    |

In addition to these primary objects, victory points may be earned for the following achievements:

* *Slay the Warlord*: If the enemy Warlord has been slain during the battle, you score 1 victory point.

* *First Blood*: The first unit, of any kind, to be destroyed is worth an additional victory point to the opposing player at the end of the game. If two or more units from opposing forces are destroyed simultaneously, each player gets a victory point.

## Stratagems ##

The small forces and chaotic nature of battles in the bowels of starships and the depths of mines limits the ability of command units to adjust the flow of battle. While the number of command points available to *CQB* forces is deliberately limited, there are never the less some general-purpose Stratagems available to either the Attacker or Defender. They may also use Stratagems generally available or those specific to their faction.

**General Stratagems**:

* *Fire Wasp* (1 CP): A durable and armed - albeit not particularly combat effective - combat drone, the Fire Wasp is used to scout enemy locations, trigger traps, and otherwise serve to help clear a path for assault parties. A Fire Wasp is a single model with the following profile that may be deployed, once purchased, by either force.

| M | WS | BS | S | T | W | A | Ld | Sv |
|---|----|----|---|---|---|---|----|----|
| 7 | 5+ | 5+ | 3 | 5 | 2 | 1 | 10 | 4+ |

Weapons:
Flamer: 8" Range, Assault D6 S4 AP0 D1.  This weapon automatically hits its target.

Abilities:
Scout Drone: At the start of the first battle round, but before the first turn begins, you may move this unit 7". It cannot end its movement within 9" of any enemy models.

Unthinking Automata: The Fire Wasp had an Ld of 10 regardless of any penalties applied to it, and does not have to make rolls for Morale tests originating from losses taken by other units, such as those caused by the *Communications Failure* rule.

Searchlight: A unit targeted by

Faction Keywords: *Any*
Keywords: *Infantry*

* *Tunnel Access* (3 CP): Sappers and combat engineers have gained access to tunnels, ventilation shafts, maintenance routes or other conduits by which to enter the battlefield. Once deployment zones have been decided, but before unit placement begins, the player may place three markers anywhere on the table no less than 12" apart, and 1" from any walls, barriers, etc. Units entering from reserve may enter from these points in addition to their usual deployment methods, though they are subject to the *Alternate Deployments* rules found in the *CQB* core rules.

* *Flanking Counter Assault* (2 CP): A detachment has been sent on a circuitous route, hoping to flank the enemy and cut them off from reenforcement. Before the game begins, the play may secretly note a single unit being held in reserve as being a flanking force. When this unit arrives from reserve, they may use their opponent's deployment zone table edge if they wish.

**Attacker's Stratagems**:

* *Breaching Charges* (1CP): Units not otherwise equipped for the breaching of barriers and bulwarks may be issued special equipment when pressed into service. Use this Stratagem during a Shooting or Assault phase when a unit attempts to destroy a door. A model in this unit may forego its attack and instead place a breaching charge. Roll a D6, and on a 2+ the targeted door is destroyed.

* *Interdiction Assault* (2 CP): Blasting charges, Webway portals, or short-range teleportarium pads allow the attackers entry to the battlefield from unexpected vectors. During the Attacker's first turn, they may place a small marker anywhere on the board more than 9" away from enemy units and 1" from any walls, barriers, etc. This marker represents a breaching point, and up to one infantry unit per turn arriving from reserves may use this entry point in lieu of their normal deployment rules.

* *Sustained Assault* (3 CP): The attacker commits a seemingly endless supply of forces to the battle, accepting horrific casualties to achieve their ends. Before the battle begins, the Attacker should choose (and secretly note down) a single Troops choice from their force. If this unit is destroyed, the Attacker may use this stratagem to bring an identical unit in from reserves. This may be done only once.

**Defender's Stratagems**:

* *Strongpoint* (3 CP): After deployment zones have been determined but before unit placement begins, the Defender may nominate one enclosed, or semi-enclosed space (such as a single room) as a hardened strongpoint. If available, additional terrain should be placed to represent this. Additionally, a small figure or marker should be placed to represent the strongpoint's power generator. Treat this generator as having Toughness 4, 2 Wounds and a 2+ armor save. Doors also have a 2+ save against Mortal Wounds. Defending units within the strongpoint add two to their armor save, and while the power generator is intact, may also re-roll any 1's To Hit when making shooting attacks.

* *Barricades* (1 CP): With time to prepare for a coming attack, the Defenders have had a chance to prepare the battlefield. After deployment zones have been determined but before unit placement begins, the defender may place three 4" wide barriers or barricades. These work as per the Warhammer 40,000 rulebook. Unlike most Stratagems, this one may be used multiple times before the battle begins.

* *Traps* (2 CP): The Defender has been able to seed the environment with traps, anti-personnel mines, deliberately sabotaged environmental control systems, or other techniques to make the environment hostile to foes. The Defender places six markers anywhere on the board after deployment areas have been decided, but before units are placed. This stratagem may be taken more than once (note: because of the cost, this is not likely to be possible without some sort of CP-boosting power). Any model moving within 1" of these markers during the game has the chance to set off a trap. In the case of units, move the entire unit before checking if the trap goes off. When this happens, roll a D6 and consult the following table:

| Roll | Result |
|------|--------|
| 1    | *Trap Disarmed:* No effect, and remove the marker from play.   | 
| 2-3    | *Inactive:* No effect this turn, but the marker remains where it is. |
| 4-6    | *Triggered:* The triggering unit takes D6 Strength 4 AP -1 hits. The marker is then removed from play. |
