# Missions and Stratagems #

Expansions are special rules that pertain to particular *CQB* environments. For example, while those boarding a void-going starship risk dangerous depressurization, those attacking an Adeptus Mechanicus research station may encounter malfunctioning machinery, or defensive systems that no longer distinguish friend from foe.

While some of these are derived from the original Zone Mortalis source material, the majority of them are fan-made, and it must be reiterated that they are *not* intended to be balanced, and should not be used outside narrative play.

## Missions ##

*Void Exposure:* Each time a weapon with Strength 4 or greater makes a wound roll of 6+, that hit is resolved at AP -3, unless its AP value is better. All weapon or attacks which have a similar rule now trigger on a roll of 5+.

*Note:* While this rule is actually marginally *less* effective than the previous 7th Edition incarnation of Rending, the overall lethality increase in 8th Edition means this rule can make things *especially* bloody. I advise only using this rule in *parts* of a CQB battle or special areas - a leaking reactor core, a chamber where a starship's hull has already ruptured, etc.

## Stratagems ##

The small forces and chaotic nature of battles in the bowels of starships and the depths of mines limits the ability of command units to adjust the flow of battle. While the number of command points available to *CQB* forces is deliberately limited, there are never the less some general-purpose Stratagems available to either the Attacker or Defender. They may also use Stratagems generally available or those specific to their faction.

**General Stratagems**:


**Attacker's Stratagems**:

* *Breaching Charges* (1CP): Units not otherwise equipped for the breaching of barriers and bulwarks may be issued special equipment when pressed into service. Use this Stratagem during a Shooting or Assault phase when a unit attempts to destroy a door. A model in this unit may forego its attack and instead place a breaching charge. Roll a D6, and on a 2+ the targeted door is destroyed.

* *Interdiction Assault* (2 CP): Blasting charges, Webway portals, or short-range teleportarium pads allow the attackers entry to the battlefield from unexpected vectors. During the Attacker's first turn, they may place a small marker anywhere on the board more than 9" away from enemy units and 1" from any walls, barriers, etc. This marker represents a breaching point, and up to one infantry unit per turn arriving from reserves may use this entry point in lieu of their normal deployment rules.

* *Sustained Assault* (3 CP): The attacker commits a seemingly endless supply of forces to the battle, accepting horrific casualties to achieve their ends. Before the battle begins, the Attacker should choose (and secretly note down) a single Troops choice from their force. If this unit is destroyed, the Attacker may use this stratagem to bring an identical unit in from reserves. This may be done only once.



**Defender's Stratagems**:

* *Strongpoint* (3 CP): After deployment zones have been determined but before unit placement begins, the Defender may nominate one enclosed, or semi-enclosed space (such as a single room) as a hardened strongpoint. If available, additional terrain should be placed to represent this. Additionally, a small figure or marker should be placed to represent the strongpoint's power generator.

Treat this generator as having Toughness 4, 2 Wounds and a 2+ armor save. Doors also have a 2+ save against Mortal Wounds.

Defending units within the strongpoint add two to their armor save, and while the power generator is intact, may also re-roll any 1's To Hit when making shooting attacks.
