# Missions and Stratagems #

Expansions are special rules that pertain to particular *CQB* environments. For example, while those boarding a void-going starship risk dangerous depressurization, those attacking an Adeptus Mechanicus research station may encounter malfunctioning machinery, or defensive systems that no longer distinguish friend from foe.

While some of these are derived from the original Zone Mortalis source material, the majority of them are fan-made, and it must be reiterated that they are *not* intended to be balanced, and should not be used outside narrative play.

## Missions ##

*Void Exposure:* Each time a weapon with Strength 4 or greater makes a wound roll of 6+, that hit is resolved at AP -3, unless its AP value is better. All weapon or attacks which have a similar rule now trigger on a roll of 5+.

*Note:* While this rule is actually marginally *less* effective than the previous 7th Edition incarnation of Rending, the overall lethality increase in 8th Edition means this rule can make things *especially* bloody. I advise only using this rule in *parts* of a CQB battle or special areas - a leaking reactor core, a chamber where a starship's hull has already ruptured, etc.

## Stratagems ##

The small forces and chaotic nature of battles in the bowels of starships and the depths of mines limits the ability of command units to adjust the flow of battle. While the number of command points available to *CQB* forces is deliberately limited, there are never the less some general-purpose Stratagems available to either the Attacker or Defender. They may also use Stratagems generally available or those specific to their faction.

**General Stratagems**:

* *Fire Wasp* (1 CP): A durable and armed - albeit not particularly combat effective - combat drone, the Fire Wasp is used to scout enemy locations, trigger traps, and otherwise serve to help clear a path for assault parties. A Fire Wasp is a single model with the following profile that may be deployed, once purchased, by either force.

| M | WS | BS | S | T | W | A | Ld | Sv |
|---|----|----|---|---|---|---|----|----|
| 7 | 5+ | 5+ | 3 | 5 | 2 | 1 | 10 | 4+ |

Weapons:
Flamer: 8" Range, Assault D6 S4 AP0 D1.  This weapon automatically hits its target.

Abilities:
Scout Drone: At the start of the first battle round, but before the first turn begins, you may move this unit 7". It cannot end its movement within 9" of any enemy models.

Unthinking Automata: The Fire Wasp had an Ld of 10 regardless of any penalties applied to it, and does not have to make rolls for Morale tests originating from losses taken by other units, such as those caused by the *Communications Failure* rule.

Searchlight: A unit targeted by

Faction Keywords: *Any*
Keywords: *Infantry*

* *Tunnel Access* (3 CP): Sappers and combat engineers have gained access to tunnels, ventilation shafts, maintenance routes or other conduits by which to enter the battlefield. Once deployment zones have been decided, but before unit placement begins, the player may place three markers anywhere on the table no less than 12" apart, and 1" from any walls, barriers, etc. Units entering from reserve may enter from these points in addition to their usual deployment methods, though they are subject to the *Alternate Deployments* rules found in the *CQB* core rules.

* *Flanking Counter Assault* (2 CP): A detachment has been sent on a circuitous route, hoping to flank the enemy and cut them off from reenforcement. Before the game begins, the play may secretly note a single unit being held in reserve as being a flanking force. When this unit arrives from reserve, they may use their opponent's deployment zone table edge if they wish.

**Attacker's Stratagems**:

* *Breaching Charges* (1CP): Units not otherwise equipped for the breaching of barriers and bulwarks may be issued special equipment when pressed into service. Use this Stratagem during a Shooting or Assault phase when a unit attempts to destroy a door. A model in this unit may forego its attack and instead place a breaching charge. Roll a D6, and on a 2+ the targeted door is destroyed.

* *Interdiction Assault* (2 CP): Blasting charges, Webway portals, or short-range teleportarium pads allow the attackers entry to the battlefield from unexpected vectors. During the Attacker's first turn, they may place a small marker anywhere on the board more than 9" away from enemy units and 1" from any walls, barriers, etc. This marker represents a breaching point, and up to one infantry unit per turn arriving from reserves may use this entry point in lieu of their normal deployment rules.

* *Sustained Assault* (3 CP): The attacker commits a seemingly endless supply of forces to the battle, accepting horrific casualties to achieve their ends. Before the battle begins, the Attacker should choose (and secretly note down) a single Troops choice from their force. If this unit is destroyed, the Attacker may use this stratagem to bring an identical unit in from reserves. This may be done only once.

**Defender's Stratagems**:

* *Strongpoint* (3 CP): After deployment zones have been determined but before unit placement begins, the Defender may nominate one enclosed, or semi-enclosed space (such as a single room) as a hardened strongpoint. If available, additional terrain should be placed to represent this. Additionally, a small figure or marker should be placed to represent the strongpoint's power generator. Treat this generator as having Toughness 4, 2 Wounds and a 2+ armor save. Doors also have a 2+ save against Mortal Wounds. Defending units within the strongpoint add two to their armor save, and while the power generator is intact, may also re-roll any 1's To Hit when making shooting attacks.

* *Barricades* (1 CP): With time to prepare for a coming attack, the Defenders have had a chance to prepare the battlefield. After deployment zones have been determined but before unit placement begins, the defender may place three 4" wide barriers or barricades. These work as per the Warhammer 40,000 rulebook. Unlike most Stratagems, this one may be used multiple times before the battle begins.

* *Traps* (2 CP): The Defender has been able to seed the environment with traps, anti-personnel mines, deliberately sabotaged environmental control systems, or other techniques to make the environment hostile to foes. The Defender places six markers anywhere on the board after deployment areas have been decided, but before units are placed. This stratagem may be taken more than once (note: because of the cost, this is not likely to be possible without some sort of CP-boosting power). Any model moving within 1" of these markers during the game has the chance to set off a trap. In the case of units, move the entire unit before checking if the trap goes off. When this happens, roll a D6 and consult the following table:

| Roll | Result |
|------|--------|
| 1    | *Trap Disarmed:* No effect, and remove the marker from play.   | 
| 2-3    | *Inactive:* No effect this turn, but the marker remains where it is. |
| 4-6    | *Triggered:* The triggering unit takes D6 Strength 4 AP -1 hits. The marker is then removed from play. |
