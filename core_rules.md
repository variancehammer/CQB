# Core Rules #

## Table Selection and Points Values ##

*CQB* battles are meant to be fought in close, tight confines, far different from the sweeping confrontations of the average 40K battlefield. This necessitates extremely dense terrain setups, and because mobility enhancing effects like transports and alternative deployment types are less available, units often move considerably slower.

As such, the advisable board size is 2'x2' for a 500 point game and 4'x4' for a 1000 point game. Larger tables, and larger point sizes, should be considered extremely large games of *CQB* and should be attempted once both players are familiar with smaller formats, or as part of team-based scenarios.

*TODO: Add power level equivs.*

It is advisable to play *CQB* games using the 'Narrative' army construction rules available in the main Warhammer 40K rulebook.

When playing with *areas* of *CQB* terrain as part of a larger table (for example, an Imperial Research Outpost and the immediately surrounding jungle) there should be a clear and mutually agreeable boundary for where this terrain begins and ends, as well as clear points to enter and exit the *CQB* area.

## Force Selection ##

Conventionally, *CQB* battles have a designated **Defender** (most often the owner of the ship/installation/mine/etc where the battle is taking place) and a designated **Attacker**. If there is no logical attacker or defender in your narrative scenario, they are both considered **Combatants**.

**Attacker** : The Attacker should use the *Forlorn Hope* detachment, described below:
* HQ: 1-2
* Elites: 1-3
* Troops: 0-3
* Fast Attack: 0-2
* Heavy Support: 0-1
* Command Benefit: None

*TODO: Add figure*

**Defender** : The Defender should use the *Patrol* detachment, described in the main Warhammer 40K rulebook.

**Combatant** : Combatants should use the *Patrol* detachment, described in the main Warhammer 40K rulebook.

If points limits allow for more than one detachment, any force may use either the *Forlorn Hope* or *Patrol* detachments for additional units.

In addition to these detachments, there are additional restrictions for *CQB* forces beyond those found in their Codex:
* No unit may be taken as a Dedicated Transport
* No unit may have a starting size greater than 15 models
* Units without the *Vehicle* keyword cannot be more than 4" wide
* Units with both the *Flyer* battlefield role may not be taken
* No unit requiring more than a 60mm round base may be chosen

## Warlords ##
Warlords for each force should be selected as normal as detailed in the main Warhammer 40K rulebook. However, Warlord Traits and Artifacts should only be used in games larger than 500 points (XX Power Levels).

## Terrain ##

Interacting with terrain is, by necessity, a larger component of *CQB* games than standard games of Warhammer 40K. As a result, there are additional special rules for terrain and environmental effects taking place in unpredictable, often unstable, environments.

**Airlocks and Doors**: Passages within *CQB* battlefields can be sealed off using reinforced doors, airlocks, force fields or other controllable barriers. These barriers have three states: *Locked*, *Unlocked* and *Restricted Access*.
* **Locked**: A locked barrier cannot be passed, save by destroying either the barrier or its locking mechanism. Once a locked barrier has been destroyed, remove it from play - it is no longer functional.
* **Unlocked**: A barrier may be opened or closed by the first unit that comes within 1" of the barrier in each turn. This unit may move through the door freely (and optionally close it behind them). A barrier may only be moved through this way once per turn - any additional units wishing to move through an *Unlocked* barrier that has been closed must destroy it.
* **Restricted Access**: A restricted access barrier is treated as *Unlocked* by one side (typically, but not always, the *Defender*), and *Locked* by the other.

**Destroying Doors**:
