# Core Rules #

## Table Selection and Points Values ##

*CQB* battles are meant to be fought in close, tight confines, far different from the sweeping confrontations of the average 40K battlefield. This necessitates extremely dense terrain setups, and because mobility enhancing effects like transports and alternative deployment types are less available, units often move considerably slower.

As such, the advisable board size is 2'x2' for a 500 point game and 4'x4' for a 1000 point game. Larger tables, and larger point sizes, should be considered extremely large games of *CQB* and should be attempted once both players are familiar with smaller formats, or as part of team-based scenarios.

*TODO: Add power level equivs.*

It is advisable to play *CQB* games using the 'Narrative' army construction rules available in the main Warhammer 40K rulebook.

When playing with *areas* of *CQB* terrain as part of a larger table (for example, an Imperial Research Outpost and the immediately surrounding jungle) there should be a clear and mutually agreeable boundary for where this terrain begins and ends, as well as clear points to enter and exit the *CQB* area.

## Force Selection ##

Conventionally, *CQB* battles have a designated **Defender** (most often the owner of the ship/installation/mine/etc where the battle is taking place) and a designated **Attacker**. If there is no logical attacker or defender in your narrative scenario, they are both considered **Combatants**.

**Attacker** : The Attacker should use the *Forlorn Hope* detachment, described below:

* HQ: 1-2
* Elites: 1-3
* Troops: 0-3
* Fast Attack: 0-2
* Heavy Support: 0-1
* Flyer: 0-2
* Command Benefit: None

*TODO: Add figure*

**Defender** : The Defender should use the *Patrol* detachment, described in the main Warhammer 40K rulebook.

**Combatant** : Combatants should use the *Patrol* detachment, described in the main Warhammer 40K rulebook.

If points limits allow for more than one detachment, any force may use either the *Forlorn Hope* or *Patrol* detachments for additional units.

In addition to these detachments, there are additional restrictions for *CQB* forces beyond those found in their Codex:

* No unit may be taken as a Dedicated Transport
* No unit may have a starting size greater than 15 models
* Units without the *Vehicle* keyword cannot be more than 4" wide
* Units with both the *Flyer* battlefield role may not be taken, unless they have Hover Mode. If taken as such, they may not leave Hover Mode.
* No unit requiring more than a 60mm round base may be chosen

## Warlords ##
Warlords for each force should be selected as normal as detailed in the main Warhammer 40K rulebook. However, Warlord Traits and Artifacts should only be used in games larger than 500 points (XX Power Levels).

## Terrain ##

Interacting with terrain is, by necessity, a larger component of *CQB* games than standard games of Warhammer 40K. As a result, there are additional special rules for terrain and environmental effects taking place in unpredictable, often unstable, environments.

**Airlocks and Doors**: Passages within *CQB* battlefields can be sealed off using reinforced doors, airlocks, force fields or other controllable barriers. These barriers have three states: *Locked*, *Unlocked* and *Restricted Access*.

* **Locked**: A locked barrier cannot be passed, save by destroying either the barrier or its locking mechanism. Once a locked barrier has been destroyed, remove it from play - it is no longer functional.
* **Unlocked**: A barrier may be opened or closed by the first unit that comes within 1" of the barrier in each turn. This unit may move through the door freely (and optionally close it behind them). A barrier may only be moved through this way once per turn - any additional units wishing to move through an *Unlocked* barrier that has been closed must destroy it.
* **Restricted Access**: A restricted access barrier is treated as *Unlocked* by one side (typically, but not always, the *Defender*), and *Locked* by the other.

**Destroying Doors**: Barriers may be destroyed - by forcing them open, puncturing holes big enough to move through, disabling their locking mechanisms or force field emitters, etc. They have however been *designed* to withstand some degree of abuse. When attempting to destroy a barrier, unless otherwise noted in the scenario rules, treat them as having Toughness 4 and 2 Wounds and a 2+ armor save.

*Note*: This is calibrated to give a meltagun firing at half range the same chance of destroying the door as in 7th edition (~ 83%). It does seem a little low at the moment, and can very easily be stripped by volume of fire in a way that you couldn't do in 7th Edition. The armor may *help* with that, but there's no way to get all the way back to "Small arms can't hurt this, bring up the demo charges" given the 8th Edition ruleset. More work may be needed here - possibly averaging the results of several iconic "bulkhead breaking weapons"

**Dangerous Ground**: The environments in CQB are inherently unstable and dangerous, with wreckage, improvised barriers, unstable footing and other hazards. As such, *CQB* areas have special rules effecting movement within them. Additionally, space is often constrained, having choke points, narrow passages, etc. Only a model that can physically fit within the space of the tabletop can move within it - if your base or model is too wide to fit through a corridor, it is impassable.

Because it is unlikely, with the density of ship bulkheads, cavern walls, etc. that there is *also* room for terrain for a unit to be completely within, units are considered in cover when the entire unit is *behind* a piece of terrain - for example, sheltering behind a sandbag wall, or a heap of rubble. There is some room for ambiguity here, so use sound judgement and consult with your opponents - it is often useful to state the intention for a unit to be fully behind terrain and ask your opponent to confirm this.

Light features, such as debris, chain-link fences, grates, metal barrels and ammunition boxes should be considered atmospheric scenery, which confers no benefit and does not obstruct movement, etc. Improvised barricades, sandbag emplacements, heavy machinery, etc. confer standard benefit of adding 1 to a unit's saving throws. Particularly heavy fortifications, such as bunkers, armored fire ports, guard stations, etc. add 2 to a unit's saving throws. Special rules for firing into - or taking cover behind - particularly hazardous and volatile terrain features such as promethium pipes, plasma reactors, xenos containment cells, etc. may add a layer of depth to the game, and should be discussed beforehand.

**No Indirect Fire**
Low ceilings, exposed girders and pipes, etc. mean firing weapons in high arcs is effectively impossible. Any weapon that has as part of its rules language similar to "This weapon can target units not visible to the bearer" cannot be fired. Use common sense when applying this rule, as this may not be applicable in all cases. Exceptions to this rule are Eldar Support Weapons armed with D-cannons, and Death Korps of Krieg Mole launchers.

**Terrain Effects by Keyword**

* Units with the *Fly*, *Artillery* or *Cavalry* keywords must roll a d6 when passing through or over any terrain that provides a cover bonus. On a roll of 6, this unit takes a Mortal Wound, regardless of any special rules they may have regarding movement. If they advance, they must take this test regardless of the terrain they pass through. This only applies to units with the *Jump Pack* or *Monster* keywords if they move more than 6".
* All other units with the *Vehicle* keyword must roll a d6 when moving within *CQB* areas in their entirety. On a roll of 6, the unit takes a Mortal Wound, regardless of any special rules they have regarding movement.
* The previous rule does not apply to units with the *Vehicle* keyword that are optimized for *CQB* environments. Treat these instead as if they used the rules for units with *Fly*, *Artillery* or *Cavalry*. These units were formerly known as "Walkers" and include Space Marine Dreadnoughts, Eldar War Walkers, Astra Militarum Sentinels, etc. A full list is available in the *Exemptions* document.

*TODO: Make the Exemptions document*

## Other Special Rules ##
**Reserves and Alternate Deployments**: Units arriving from reserve via standard deployment can only enter via the entry and exit points specified before the game begins. Units with rules that allow them to be repositioned after deployment, such as the Astra Militarum Scout Sentinel's "Scout Vehicle" rule or which alter the rules for where a model may be placed *during deployment* such as the Space Marine Scout's "Concealed Positions" work as normal.

Any alternate deployment mechanism that involves a unit being deployed somewhere other than the battlefield, such as the Eldar Ranger's 'Appear Unbidden' rule or Space Marine Reiver's "Grav-chutes", carry considerably higher risk. It is possible to collide with walls and other terrain, find your intended positions obstructed, or at the very worse, teleport directly into a solid surface. If these units deploy within 1" of a wall, barrier, or other terrain feature, the unit automatically takes d3 Mortal Wounds, to represent mishaps during deployment or members of the unit unable to enter the combat area due to obstructions.

**Halls of Death**: *CQB* environments are conducive to particular types of weapons. Those capable of filling a combined space with shrapnel, or sucking the air out of a room in conflagration are devastatingly effective. Any ranged weapon that has as part of its rules language similar to "This weapon automatically hits its target" may now *also* re-roll failed To Wound rolls. If the weapon already had such an ability, it gains +1 Strength. Ranged weapons with the "Grenade" type that inflict multiple hits also gain this rule.

**No Retreat**: *CQB* games are often desperate struggles where an orderly retreat is much less likely. Retreating units may have their escape routes cut off, they may get lost in the complex environment, or they may genuinely be trapped, the void ship they launched from now a smoldering wreck. Units use their leadership in the Morale phase as normal, however they add 1 to the number of units lost due to a failed Morale roll to reflect the increased likelihood of panicking units becoming combat ineffective.

**Communications Failures**: *CQB* environments are difficult ones to maintain coherent command and control structures in. Units are often extremely limited in what they can see, their communications may be jammed, and they are often forced to rely on the leadership of whatever officer they can find - often a junior one. A unit that is within 1" of a friendly unit that has lost one or more models due to a failed Morale roll itself loses 1 unit, to reflect growing local panic and incomplete information.
