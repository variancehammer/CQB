# Introduction #

*CQB* is a fan-made expansion for Warhammer 40K 8th Edition, intended to support "Zone Mortalis"-style games, introduced by Forge World. These games feature close quarters fighting in tight, often highly enclosed environments, such as Space Hulks, boarding actions, underground mines and within buildings.

## Guiding Principles ##

The goal behind *CQB* is to build a set of modular rules to support these kind of games, and support narrative play. The rules themselves are divided into four categories:

* **Core Rules** : These are as close an adaptation of the original Zone Mortalis rules as possible, with a minimum of creative interpretation. Where this interpretation does happen, some commentary is included for how this was arrived at.
* **Optional Rules** : These are rules inspired by other products, sources, etc. that can be added to enhance the feel of the game.
* **Expansions** : There are larger sets of optional rules expressly designed to add a particular type of "flavor" to the game - for example, rules for boarding actions, rules for research stations, etc.
* **Missions and Stratagems** : As the name suggests, this is a collection of missions and stratagems suitable for use in *CQB* games.

In addition, there is an important note on the design philosophy of *CQB*: **These rules are not balanced**. They are intended for a particular form of narrative game, and as such may favor particular units, armies or army builds.

## Notable Deviations ##
This is a collection of notable deviations from either the original *Zone Mortalis* rules, or the main rulebook for Warhammer 40K:

**Zone Mortalis**: 

* Several rules, such as Difficult Terrain and the rules for wrecked vehicles have been removed as they no longer exist in the paradigm of 8th edition.
* Removed most mentions of Walkers, as they don't exist as a discrete category anymore - this makes them *less* useful in *CQB*, which is a problem. The "Exemptions" document attempts to ammend this by making a sub-list of *CQB*-optimized *Vehicles* that suffer lesser penalties. Note that this list is particularly subjective.
* Deepstrike Mishap no longer exists as a concept - the new rules reflect an increased risk of losses due to these types of deployments.
* Similarly, "Falling Back" now means something entirely different, so the rules for the Morale phase have been entirely rewritten.
* Template weapons no longer exist, and so that section has been re-written. I've tried to account for flamers, frag cannons, frag grenades, etc. But there's no real way at the moment to distinguish what *used* to be a Blast or Template weapon inherently. I think this covers the majority of use cases however.
* Initiative no longer exists as stat, which makes Reaction Fire hard to roll as an Initiative test. This has been replaced with a 4+, which is a buff to some and a nerf to others. The note about *Counter-Attack* not being allowed has also been removed, as this is not a thing anymore. If I can find specific examples of rules in the spirit of that one (a bonus coming as-if one had charged) I will include them.
* Rending as a USR is gone as well. This has been replicated as closely as possible for *Cold Void and Poisoned Air*. Pinning is similarly no longer a concept, and has been dropped.
* Some modifications have been made to the Catastrophic Damage table to reflect 8th Edition. Mostly, attempting to duplicate the effects, even if the rules are now fairly different. For example, replacing scatter with a flat chance to miss.
* Translating SPs to CPs is not an exact science. The assumption is that it works largely 1:1, based on 2 SPs and 2 CPs being "most but not quite all" of their respective available resources.

**Main Rulebook**:

* The nature of *CQB* battles necessitates a departure from the "in terrain" paradigm of 8th Edition back to the 7th Edition paradigm of "behind terrain". Editing the terrain rules is probably the largest wholesale change.
