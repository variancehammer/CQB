# CQB Draft Rules #

* in progress*

# Introduction #

*CQB* is a fan-made expansion for Warhammer 40K 8th Edition, intended to support "Zone Mortalis"-style games, introduced by Forge World. These games feature close quarters fighting in tight, often highly enclosed environments, such as Space Hulks, boarding actions, underground mines and within buildings.

## Guiding Principles ##

The goal behind *CQB* is to build a set of modular rules to support these kind of games, and support narrative play. The rules themselves are divided into three categories:

* **Core Rules** : These are as close an adaptation of the original Zone Mortalis rules as possible, with a minimum of creative interpretation. Where this interpretation does happen, some commentary is included for how this was arrived at.
* **Optional Rules** : These are rules inspired by other products, sources, etc. that can be added to enhance the feel of the game.
* **Expansions** : There are larger sets of optional rules expressly designed to add a particular type of "flavor" to the game - for example, rules for boarding actions, rules for research stations, etc.

In addition, there is an important note on the design philosophy of *CQB*: **These rules are not balanced**. They are intended for a particular form of narrative game, and as such may favor particular units, armies or army builds.

## Notable Deviations ##
This is a collection of notable deviations from either the original *Zone Mortalis* rules, or the main rulebook for Warhammer 40K:

**Zone Mortalis**: 

**Main Rulebook**:
* The nature of *CQB* battles necessitates a departure from the "in terrain" paradigm of 8th Edition back to the 7th Edition paradigm of "behind terrain". Editing the terrain rules is probably the largest wholesale change.
